# 💳 Payment Search Challenge

Welcome to the Payment Search Challenge! This is a frontend coding challenge designed to assess your ability to implement a payment search feature using modern web technologies.

Your task is to build a payment search interface that allows users to:
- View payment details organised in a table
- Search for payments by payment ID & currency and clear filters
- Handle various edge cases and error states
- Implement pagination for the table

> **Note**: We don't expect candidates to complete all steps. Please work your way through the steps incrementally, focusing on quality over quantity. Each step builds upon the previous one, so take your time to implement each feature properly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The project comes with the following pre-configured technologies:

- **React 19** - For building the user interface
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling and responsive design
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** - For API mocking
- **Vitest** - For testing
- **Testing Library** - For component testing

> **Note**: You are free to use additional libraries, packages, or technologies to solve this challenge. Feel free to install and use any dependencies that will help you implement the features more effectively or improve the user experience.

> **Important**: You'll discuss your implementation in a technical interview, including your architectural decisions, trade-offs, and alternative approaches you considered. Make sure you understand every line of code you submit.

## 📡 API Documentation

The project uses MSW to mock the payment search API. The API URL is defined in `src/constants/index.ts` as `API_URL = "/api/payments"`.

### Search Payments Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/payments`

**Description:** Search and retrieve payments with filtering and pagination support.

#### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `search` | string | No | `""` | Search term to filter payments (supports Payment ID, Status, Currency, Customer Name) |
| `currency` | string | No | `""` | Filter by currency code (`USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `AUD`, `CAD`, `ZAR`) - available in `src/constants/index.ts` |
| `page` | number | No | `1` | Page number for pagination |
| `pageSize` | number | No | `5` | Number of payments per page |

#### Request Examples

```bash
GET /api/payments?search=pay_134&currency=USD&page=1&pageSize=5
```

#### Response Format

**Success Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "payments": [
    {
      "id": "pay_123456789",
      "customerName": "John Doe",
      "amount": 150.00,
      "customerAddress": "123 Main St, City, Country",
      "currency": "USD",
      "status": "completed",
      "date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "description": "Payment for services",
      "clientId": "cli_123"
    }
  ],
  "total": 25,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 5
}
```

#### Available Test Data

The mock API includes the following payment IDs for testing:
- `pay_134_1`, `pay_134_2`, `pay_134_3`, `pay_134_4`, `pay_134_5` - Various payment statuses
- `pay_205_1`, `pay_205_2`, `pay_205_3`, `pay_205_4`, `pay_205_5` - Multiple payments with different currencies
- `pay_404` - Returns `404` error
- `pay_500` - Returns `500` error

## 🌐 Localization (i18n)

**Important**: Use the i18n constants for all user-facing text. All strings can be found in the constants files:

- **Main i18n strings**: `src/constants/i18n.ts` - Contains all user-facing text including labels, buttons, messages, and table headers

Import the i18n constants like this:
```typescript
import { I18N } from './constants/i18n';
```

**Note**: These strings are used by our tests and scoring system, so using the exact i18n constants is required for your solution to pass validation.


## 📝 Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

- 🧹 Clean, maintainable code
- 🔒 Proper TypeScript usage
- 🏗️ Well-structured components
- 🎯 Efficient state management

## 💡 Tips

- **Start with Step 1 and work through each step incrementally**
- Run tests after each step to verify your progress
- Keep accessibility in mind throughout development
- Use TypeScript effectively
- Test with the provided payment IDs to verify error handling
- Don't hesitate to install additional packages if they help you solve the problem more efficiently
- Consider using libraries for state management, form handling, or UI components if they improve your solution

## 📋 Implementation Steps

This challenge is designed to be completed incrementally. Each step builds upon the previous one, and you can run tests to verify your progress.

Good luck! 🚀

### Step 1: Basic Payment List ✅
**Goal**: Fetch and display payments in a table with proper formatting

**Requirements**:
- Fetch payments from the API with `page=1` and `pageSize=5`
- Display payments in a table with headers using i18n strings (see `src/constants/i18n.ts`)
